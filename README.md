# 🥋 JS Dojo

**Apps and games, forged in the JavaScript Dojo.**

Welcome to **JS-Dojo** — a growing collection of interactive JavaScript projects, games, and experiments.  
Each project lives in its own folder and runs entirely in the browser — no frameworks, no build tools, just **Vanilla JS**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
